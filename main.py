   - Turn management and combat states
   - AoE and multi-target support
   - Combat log and history


3. Spell/Move System
   - Spell slots and cooldowns
   - Multiple damage types and resistances
   - Effect application and duration tracking
   - Spell categories and organization
   - Moveset saving and loading


4. UI Improvements
   - Form-based input for complex commands
   - Rich embeds for information display
   - Interactive menus and buttons
   - Better feedback and error messages
   - Help system with examples


5. Quality of Life Features
   - Dice rolling with various methods
   - State saving and loading
   - Combat automation options
   - Batch commands for efficiency
   - Custom command aliases


6. Additional Systems
   - Random name generation
   - Grid-based movement
   - Effect combinations
   - Custom effect creation
   - Sound effects and multimedia


Code Organization:
- core/: Core systems and data structures
- modules/: Feature-specific implementations
- utils/: Helper functions and constants
- menu/: UI components and views


This rewrite aims to provide a more maintainable, extensible, and user-friendly bot
while preserving and enhancing the functionality of the original version.
